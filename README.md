# âž— Simple-Calculator
## Description
This is a simple calculator app built using HTML, CSS and JS. It takes number entries from buttons selected, performs the selected operators on them and prints it out on the screen. Inspiration and guide for this project is from The Odin Project course. You can access this project on my website or at the link in the "About" section of this page.
